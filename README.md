# PDFC
This is a code base of my first software that i created using Python and PyPDF2 but now it is being modified to use PyMuPDF instead

You can visit the code base for the original software here [https://github.com/siyabongakonile/PDFC](https://github.com/siyabongakonile/PDFC).

## Running the program
